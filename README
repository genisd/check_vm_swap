NAME
    check_vm_swap - A Nagios plugin to check swap in/out operations

    activities

SYNOPSIS
    check_vm_swap --warning w --critical c [-v]

DESCRIPTION
    check_vm_swap checks swap activities. it does NOT check total amount of
    available swap storage. As long as kernel has enough swap space,
    swapping is not a problem. Mordern kernel rarely swap process. Even if
    it does, it's OK if the swapped process is idling. However, many
    swapping activity is almost always a problem. check_swap from Nagios
    plugins just checks how much swap space is available and screams when
    swap is used. If swapped process has been idle for a while and other
    processes need memory, it's okay. That's what kernel is supposed to do.
    I needed a plugin to check how often kernel swap-in/out process.

    by default, it monitors how often kernel swaps in/out. paging in/out is
    also supported.

  OPTIONS
    --warning, --critical
        per-five-minutes thresholds for swap operation.

    --type TYPE
        What VM activity to monitor, "swap" or "page", default is swap.

SEE ALSO
    check_swap, if you really want to monitor how much swap space left.
